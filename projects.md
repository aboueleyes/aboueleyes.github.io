Here's some advice I'd like to give to my colleagues who are working on their university projects.


I'd like to thank my friend [Ahmed Mamdouh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad45123/) for helping me write this.


## Don't work for grades


Don't work for grades. The whole point of the project is to learn new stuff, deepen your understanding of the course concepts. Make something 

that are you proud of to be put in your resume.



## Start using Unix-like Shell


One of the things that I highly recommend using is to start using the command line. If you are a `Linux/MacOS` user just learn and start 

using your terminal. If you are using `Windows` you may consider using [`WSL2`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Use Version Control 


Regardless of how small the project is, don't send the code to your teammates by mail :D, use version control to track your files, and use 

services like `Github` to easily collaborate with your teammates.

## Use linter and formatters


Use code linters to assure code quality. for example, I use [`sonalint`](https://www.sonarlint.org/) while working on `java` projects.

I also recommend using formatters like [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/).



## Git commit change standard 


Use a standard format for the git commit message. and make it detailed as possible.

[Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/) is an example convention



## Use Unit tests 


Writing unit tests is a good skill that is good to have while you're a student.

## Code review 


Usually, you don't have a mentor working on a university project. So the projects team should consider reviewing each others' code.

## Choose your teammates wisely


The key to choosing a good teammate is that he's willing to learn new things and flexible to try new things out.



Thank you for reading this. I hope you like it. If you have any advice for me please tell me ðŸ˜ƒ.
