Here's some advices I'd like to give to my colleagues who are working on their university projects.

I'd like to thank my friend [Ahmed Mumdouh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad45123/) for helping me write this.

## Don't work for grades

Don't work for grades. The whole point of the project is to learn new stuff, deepen your understanding of the course concepts. Make something 
that are you proud of to be put in your resume.


## Start using Unix-Like Shell

One of the things that I highly recommend using is to start using the command line. If your are  `Linux/MacOS` user just learn and start 
using your terminal. If you are using `Windows` you may consider using [`WSL2`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Use Version Control 

Regardless how small the project is, don't send the code to your teammates by mail :D, use version control to track your files and use 
services like `Github` to easily collaborate with your teammates.

## Use linter and formatters

Use code linters to assure code quality. for example I use [`sonalint`](https://www.sonarlint.org/) while working in `java` projects.
I also recommend using formatters like [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/).


## Git commit change standard 

Use standard format for the git commit message. and make it detailed as possible.
[Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/) is an example convention


## Use Unit tests 

Writing unit tests is a good skill that is good to have while you're student.

## Code review 

Usually you don't have a mentor working in a university project. So the projects team should consider review each others' code.

## Choose your teammates wisely

The key to choose a good teammate is that he's willing to learn new things and flexible to try new things out.


Thank you for reading this. I hope you like it. If you have an advice for me please tell it 😃.
