      <description>Writing English words and writing code are very different activities. When programming, you spend more time switching files, reading, navigating, and editing code compared to writing a long stream. It makes sense that there are different types of programs for writing English words versus code
As programmers, we spend most of our time editing code, so it’s worth investing time mastering an editor that fits your needs.
Vim has a rich history; it originated from the Vi editor (1976), and it’s still being developed today.</description>
