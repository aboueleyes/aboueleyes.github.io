      <description>Basic search and replace In Vim, you can find and replace text using the :substitute (:s) command.
To run commands in Vim, you must be in normal mode, the default mode when starting the editor. To go back to normal mode from any other mode, just press the ‘Esc’ key.
The general form of the substitute command is as follows:
:[range]s/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] [count]The command searches each line in [range] for a {pattern}, and replaces it with a {string}.</description>

      <description>Vim is an awesome editor. Vim provides a tool to save your time, helping you to get back to the previous mindset of the last time you left the project. It’s called sessions.
 A Session keeps the Views for all windows, plus the global settings. You can save a Session and when you restore it later the window layout looks the same. You can use a Session to quickly switch between different projects, automatically loading the files you were last working on in that project.</description>
